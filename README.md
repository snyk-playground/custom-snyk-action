# Custom Snyk Action

This is a simple example of a [custom snyk action](.github/actions/custom-snyk/action.yml) that installs the snyk binary, runs a monitor, but requires a Snyk org to function.

See this [workflow](.github/actions/custom-snyk/action.yml) for an example of it being used.

This is a composite action, to learn more about it refer to GitHub's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action#creating-an-action-metadata-file).
